# Solidity Simple Social App

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract and a sample script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

The contract has been deployed to the rinkeby test net. You can find it on etherscan [here.](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x880c3926a84150b10e4714871743c4524d945787)

The UI is currently hosted on replit and you can visit it [here.](https://waveportal-starter-project.jsiewierski11.repl.co/)
